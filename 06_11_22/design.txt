Goal: 
sink the browsers ships in the fewest number of guesses. You're given a rating based on how well you perform

Setup: 
When the game program is launched, the computer places ships on a virtual grid. When that's done, the game asks for your first guess.

How you play:
The browser will prompt you to enter a guess and you'll type in a grid location. In response to your guess, you'll see a result of "hit", "miss", or "you sank my battleship!" When you sink all the ships, the game ends by displaying your rating


High-level Design:
1: User starts the game
  1A: Game places a battleship at a random location on the grid.
2: Game play begins
Repeat the following until the battleship is sunk:
 2A: Prompt user for a guess("2", "0", etc.)
 2B: Check the user's guess against the battleship to look for a hit, miss or sink.

 3: game finishes
 give the user a rating based on the number of guesses.



 1: starts
  1A: game Setup
 2:
  2A: Get user guess
  2B: check guess
    if miss get user guess against
    if hit mark ship as hit user guess's against
    if ship is sunk move to 3
3: Display user score/rating
4: game over


MVP:
Simple virtual grid
ship: 3 spaces
Grid: 1 row of 7 columns (0-6)

Get user input:
  prompt function when we need to get a new location fro the user well use prompt to display a message and get the input

Display results:
alert function to show the output of the game.


This will be clunky but it will work.
